As practicing for the Humber IEEE Hackathon in May 2019, I focus on algorithm and data structure. Though I'm still new to the field, I'm always believe in my own logical thinking ways, so Problem Solving is totally what I want to dive in more in the long way.

What I've learn so far includes Brute Force, Dynamic Programming, some Geometry and Graph Theory and Data Structures.
